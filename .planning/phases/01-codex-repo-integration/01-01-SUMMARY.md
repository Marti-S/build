# Phase 1 Plan 01: Codex Repo Integration Summary

**Codex local installs now generate repo-scoped /gsd skills and AGENTS.md guidance directly from existing command frontmatter.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T15:50:08Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T15:51:32Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 33

## Accomplishments

- Added Codex skill generation that scans `commands/gsd` frontmatter and writes `.codex/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`.
- Created a Codex AGENTS.md template and safe merge logic for repo-root guidance.
- Added `--codex` runtime selection with local-only enforcement in the installer CLI.

## Task Commits

No commits were executed per instruction. Intended commit messages:

1. **Task 1: Generate Codex skills from /gsd command frontmatter** - `feat(01-01): generate Codex skills from /gsd frontmatter`
2. **Task 2: Add Codex AGENTS.md template and merge logic** - `feat(01-01): add Codex AGENTS template and installer merge logic`
3. **Task 3: Wire Codex runtime selection into the installer** - `feat(01-01): add Codex runtime selection to installer`

**Plan metadata (not executed):** `docs(01-01): complete Codex repo integration plan`
