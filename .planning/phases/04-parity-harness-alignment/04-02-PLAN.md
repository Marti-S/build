<objective>
Update maintainer docs so parity runs include phase override guidance and SUMMARY artifact troubleshooting.

Purpose: Prevent parity runs from failing due to missing roadmap phases and clarify how to resolve missing SUMMARY artifacts.
Output: Updated parity test instructions in `MAINTAINERS.md`.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add phase override guidance to parity instructions</name>
  <files>MAINTAINERS.md</files>
  <action>
    - In the Parity Tests section, add a note that default phase `98` may not exist in the roadmap and parity should be run with `--phase` pointing to a roadmap phase.
    - Provide a concrete example command (e.g., `npm run test:parity -- --phase 4`) near the existing run instructions.
    - Keep the guidance concise and aligned with the existing documentation tone.
  </action>
  <verify>Read `MAINTAINERS.md` and confirm the parity run instructions include a `--phase` example and mention the default phase caveat.</verify>
  <done>Parity instructions include explicit `--phase` override guidance with a working example.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Document missing SUMMARY artifact behavior</name>
  <files>MAINTAINERS.md</files>
  <action>
    - Add a short troubleshooting note explaining that parity runs will fail if execute-phase SUMMARY artifacts are missing.
    - Point maintainers to rerun parity using a phase that produces SUMMARY outputs and to review the parity report for summary status.
    - Place the note near the parity output/exit codes or as a short troubleshooting sub-section.
  </action>
  <verify>Read `MAINTAINERS.md` and confirm the parity section includes guidance about missing SUMMARY artifacts and how to resolve it.</verify>
  <done>Docs explicitly explain the SUMMARY-missing failure mode and remediation steps.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Maintainer docs now show `--phase` guidance and the SUMMARY-missing troubleshooting note in the parity section.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Parity documentation explains phase override and summary artifact troubleshooting clearly and concisely.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-parity-harness-alignment/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
